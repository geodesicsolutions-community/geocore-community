//_samples/listing.get_client.php


//Sample API client, that gets the details and images for a given listing


/*
Note: This is intended for people that are familiar with editing PHP
	files.

Instructions for using this as a stand-alone API client:
1.	Edit this file:  Look for the line that starts with "$xmlrpc_location".
	Change it to:
	$xmlrpc_location = "XMLRPC.class.php";
2.	Set the rest of the "Required Settings" as needed (like $website, $api_key, etc)
	Each setting has it's own instructions right above it.

	There may be optional settings as well, those can be set by
	un-commenting them and set them as instructed.
3.	Upload the modified file to a location that you can access from the web.
	It does not have to be on the same website as the Geo software.
4.	Upload the file "XMLRPC.class.php" to the same location that you uploaded
	this file to.  The file is located in the Geo software at:
	classes/rpc/XMLRPC.class.php
5.	In a web browser, visit the file you uploaded in step 3.  You should see
	the results of the API call.
